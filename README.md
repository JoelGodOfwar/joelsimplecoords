JoelGodOfWar's Simple Coordinate Mod
==============
This is a mod which adds various utilities and enhancements to make your life easier. Designed with the moderate Minecrafter in mind.
It adds your coordinates(Nether and Overworld, and can auto send them to chat.), a compass(NSEW), a clock(Day/Night), XP (Ammount you curently have, and ammount needed for next level.), Biome, and Chunk Coordinates. It works in both single player and multiplayer servers.

I'm releasing this as open source. Make sure to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/JoelGodOfwar/joelsimplecoords/). If you happen to use the code in any way make sure to send me a PM because I'd love to see what you make with it.

See this mod on the Minecraft Forums [here](URL coming soon) or on CurseForge [here](URL coming soon). These are the only two sites I post new downloads to.

To compile into jar, shift right click in directory with gradlew, then open command prompt and type "gradlew build".
The file will be in the forge dirctory/eclipse/build/libs
