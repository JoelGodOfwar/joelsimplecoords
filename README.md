JoelGodOfWar's Simple Coordinate Mod
==============

Current verion is "1.8_0.9", please make sure you download that version, and not 1.8-0.2.

This is a mod which adds various utilities and enhancements to make your life easier. Designed with the moderate Minecrafter in mind.
It adds your coordinates(Nether and Overworld, and can auto send them to chat.), a compass(NSEW), a clock(Day/Night), XP (Ammount you curently have, and ammount needed for next level.), Biome, Chunk Coordinates, and Potion Timers. It works in both single player and multiplayer servers.

This mod was specifically made for the Datacraft Server at Dataless822.net, to help with linking nether portals, and then had other features added.

I'm releasing this as open source. Make sure to check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/JoelGodOfwar/joelsimplecoords/). If you happen to use the code in any way make sure to send me a PM because I'd love to see what you make with it.
